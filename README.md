# colorful-motivation

Replaces the (boring and white) new tab page on Chrome with (fun and colorful) motivation.  Displays your current age (down to the second), and generates a background color based on that age.  Click on the birthday in the bottom-left corner to modify current settings.  The hex color is generated from the 2nd through 7th decimal places (the beginning doesn't change much, but the least significant number changes ~5 seconds).  You can see the current hex color being used in the bottom right corner.

Based off of idea put forth in Chrome extension "Motivation" by maccman.
